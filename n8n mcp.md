_incl the PowerShell section, time to brew some üçµ_

Install - Node Package Execute `npx` by 
```
npm install -g npx
```


### Step 1: Open Command Palette
Type `>MCP` in the command palette (search for `VSC` at the top)

![Command Palette](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0b3bf38-2c75-4c2b-a7c4-bb675628b98c)

### Step 2: Add New Server
Click "Add New Server"

### Step 3: Adding server

### Step 4: NPM Package
<img width="751" height="250" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5c24161-55d7-4756-93c9-d9d26383cd26" />

### Step 5: Enter the package name `n8n`

### Step 6: give it a name:

If you did it correctly, then you should see this sample configuration:

### Configuring the settings for the server ###
We need to adjust this code to it.
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "n8n-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["n8n-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "MCP_MODE": "stdio",
        "LOG_LEVEL": "error",
        "DISABLE_CONSOLE_OUTPUT": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
At the end, it will look like so: -_make sure you save the file_

If you did it correctly, you can now start the server by going to: `>mcp` `List Servers` -Select the n8n server just created -_right click_  > Start

If you did that correctly, then you can see the discovered tools from the repo.

Add this and save the file (you can customize this verbose too)

```
you have access to MCP server call `n8n-mcp`. This tool allows you to search through n8n documentation and workflows to create n8n workflows and nodes.
If a question is asked about n8n you should always use this tool to find the answer.
```

### Running your first prompt ### 
I'm using this as sample:
```
create a n8n workflow that will start manually and it will read emails from outlook, setup an IF conditional if emails then send notfications via gotify
```

Best GPT agents: `GPT-4o, Claude 3.5` (beyond this is overkill, after all, the info will not come from them but the MCP)

It will ask you to `Allow` the conversation

If you did everything correctly, you should now see the MCP that was run and some further prompts in the `show more`

üëâ In some cases, you will find the code in the middle of the context 

Now you can copy the JSON file and drop it in n8n canvas

You're done! üéâ

üëâ The red Warnings ‚ùå here indicate that you need to create credentials, obviously.
