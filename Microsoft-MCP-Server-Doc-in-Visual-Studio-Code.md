# üöÄ Microsoft Copilot MCP Server Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up and use the Microsoft Copilot Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server in Visual Studio Code to access the latest official Microsoft documentation.

## üìã What is an MCP Server?

MCP Servers offer flexible configuration options at both user and workspace levels:
- üîÑ User-level settings automatically apply across all VS Code sessions
- üíº Particularly practical for users working with Microsoft technologies
- üîÄ Allows configuring different MCP Servers for Microsoft vs non-Microsoft environments

### Step 6: Add Instruction Content
Your instruction should look something along these lines:

```markdown
---
applyTo: '**'
---
You have access to MCP tools called `microsoft_docs_search` and `microsoft_docs_fetch` - these tools allow you to search through and fetch Microsoft's latest official documentation, and that information might be more detailed or newer than what's in your training data set.

If a question includes Intune, config manager, Exchange, Teams, Outlook, and all other Microsoft products, services, or technology, you should leverage these tools to search for an answer and to fetch content for deep research.
```

![Instruction Content](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1ad4f3b-75a5-4b5b-a2a4-f35d3c366cb1)

### Step 7: Save Instructions
Press `Ctrl` + `S` to save, then you can close this window.

If you get a message to allow sensitive files in the Copilot instruction, you can skip it since you just saved it above.

## üß™ Time for Testing

For this example, I will prompt for:
```
I'm trying to add a bundle id to an app configuration profile policy in intune but I'm not sure on what format I should use
```

üëâ if you have not configured your Copilot then this popup will come up, choose your sign-in Accordingly, Restart after its setup

üëâ A way to see if the MCP server is ready is by: `> MCP` List Servers > Right Click to the one created > then Choose your option accordingly

If you did it correctly, you should see the reference from the `MCP Server` like so:

* On regular search that did not have to do with our above instructions, it would not pick up any fetching:
