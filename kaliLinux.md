Workflow: Running Linux on an independent machine. I have a Windows Host that will do the talking to that machine via VSC


Requirements:
- Setting up Kali
* I'll use a VM on hyperV for kali: Download the latest version here: https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines
* * Uncompress it, and open it with HypverV (_you should already know how to set up a HyperV Host otherwise ,use a full machine_)
Note: if the Kali hyper image is used, the creds are kali/kali

Update the machine:
```
sudo apt update and sudo apt upgrade -y
```

- Download and install VSC: https://code.visualstudio.com/
